# Crystal Fork - with PRP Generation

> **Note**: This is an enhanced fork of Crystal with Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs) for structured AI-assisted development.

## The Concept
Crystal is a Multi-Session Claude Code Manager.

The idea was to incorporate the ability to generate PRPs (see https://github.com/Wirasm/PRPs-agentic-eng)
This code could be a good starting point to add customized templates allowing users to easily generate specific applications, such as Agents, Websites, etc.  The PRP generation works quite well and I've actually used it to generate PRPs that I have copied and given to Claude manually while working on this fork.

Claude made some changes to the template struture that Rasmmus designed to merge the PRP instructions and templates into a single file. It also sugessted a future enhancement where the Creation Dialog could have optional variable replacement fields and modify those in the combined prompt/template. Some of this logic is in place in the metadata.json file that accompanies each template.md file and also in the template generation, but has not been implemented in the front end.

I've also tested using a PRP in New Session generation.  I haven't looked at or tested the (existing) Include Documents function. A future enhancement might involved have a document library or to use Cole's (https://github.com/coleam00) mcp-crawl or Archon to add documentation. 

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed
- Claude Code CLI installed and logged in

## Original Crystal Overview

Crystal is an Electron desktop application that lets you run, inspect, and test multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously using git worktrees. It provides structured development with Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs) that guide AI-assisted development for longer coding sessions.


## The Crystal Workflow

1. Create sessions from prompts, each in an isolated git worktree
2. Iterate with Claude Code inside your sessions. Each iteration will make a commit so you can always go back.
3. Review the diff changes and make manual edits as needed
4. Squash your commits together with a new message and rebase to your main branch.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üöÄ Parallel Sessions** - Run multiple Claude Code instances at once
- **üå≥ Git Worktree Isolation** - Each session gets its own branch
- **üíæ Session Persistence** - Resume conversations anytime
- **üîß Git Integration** - Built-in rebase and squash operations
- **üìä Change Tracking** - View diffs and track modifications
- **üîî Notifications** - Desktop alerts when sessions need input
- **üèóÔ∏è Run Scripts** - Test changes instantly without leaving Crystal
- **üìã Product Requirement Prompts** - Structured development with AI-assisted PRP generation
- **üéØ Focused Workflow** - Streamlined session creation with PRP integration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed and logged in
- Git installed
- Git repository (Crystal will initialize one if needed)

### 1. Create a Project
Create a new project if you haven't already. This can be an empty folder or an existing git repository. Crystal will initialize git if needed.

### 2. Create Sessions from a Prompt
For any feature you're working on, create one or multiple new sessions:
- Each session will be an isolated git worktree
- Optionally select a Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) to guide development
- PRPs can be generated with AI assistance using Claude Code

### 3. Monitor and Test Your Changes
As sessions complete:
- **Configure run scripts** in project settings to test your application without leaving Crystal
- **Use the diff viewer** to review all changes and make manual edits as needed
- **Continue conversations** with Claude Code if you need additional changes

### 4. Finalize Your Changes
When everything looks good:
- Click **"Rebase to main"** to squash all commits with a new message and rebase them to your main branch
- This creates a clean commit history on your main branch

### Git Operations
- **Rebase from main**: Pull latest changes from main into your worktree
- **Squash and rebase to main**: Combine all commits and rebase onto main
- Always preview commands with tooltips before executing

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Developing Crystal with Crystal

If you're using Crystal to develop Crystal itself, you need to use a separate data directory to avoid conflicts with your main Crystal instance:

```bash
# Set the run script in your Crystal project settings to:
pnpm run setup && CRYSTAL_DIR=~/.crystal_test pnpm electron-dev
```

This ensures:
- Your development Crystal instance uses `~/.crystal_test` for its data
- Your main Crystal instance continues using `~/.crystal` 
- Worktrees won't conflict between the two instances
- You can safely test changes without affecting your primary Crystal setup
